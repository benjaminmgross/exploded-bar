#Exploded Bar

`matplotlib` rocks, but there's no ability to do an "exploded bar chart". This file provides the basic nuts and bolts and is well commented so you can figure out how to make one that suits your needs. No it's not pretty. Neither are you.

#Run the Example

Do something like:

	$ git clone git@github.com:benjaminmgross/exploded-bar.git
	$ cd exploded bar
	$ ipython
	
	Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
	Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

	IPython 1.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
	?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
	%quickref -> Quick reference.
	help      -> Python's own help system.
	object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

	In [1]: import exploded_bar
	In [2]: exploded_bar.run_demo()

No I didn't make it a package, it's like 20 lines long... geez.
